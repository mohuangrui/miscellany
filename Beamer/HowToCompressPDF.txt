From StackExchange "how-to-make-the-pdfs-produced-by-pdflatex-smaller"

A common approach is to let Ghostscript (gs) optimize and compress the PDF after it has been created with pdflatex.

Ghostscript is installed by most Linux distributions and easily available for other platforms (Windows as binaries, MacOS via MacPorts). In fact, almost all size-optimizing tools for PDF (save for Acrobat) you can find on the internet, internally use Ghostscript -- so you can as well call it directly.

gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=foo-compressed.pdf foo.pdf

The level of compression is adjusted by the -dPDFSETTINGS switch:

-dPDFSETTINGS=/screen   (screen-view-only quality, 72 dpi images)
-dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook    (low quality, 150 dpi images)
-dPDFSETTINGS=/printer  (high quality, 300 dpi images)
-dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress (high quality, color preserving, 300 dpi imgs)
-dPDFSETTINGS=/default  (almost identical to /screen)
